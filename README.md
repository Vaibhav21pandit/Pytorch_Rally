# Pytorch_Rally
This Repository containes codes that I initially used to learn PyTorch \
\
Further it expanded to all the popular Computer Vision applications coded in PyTorch. \
\
It has 3 following Notebooks- \
1.) **Torch Basics**-
      a.)Tensor Operations with Pytorch \
      b.)Exploring basic functions provided by the torch API,Functions from TorchVision API \
      c.)Linear/Logistic regression with torch \
      d.)Defining a Linear Neural Net and Classifying MNIST data \
      e.)Defining a CNN and classifying CIFAR-10 Data. \
2.)**Torch Advanced**-
    a.)AutoEncoders on MNIST,\
    b.)Variational AutoEncoders on MNIST \ 
    c.)basic GAN on MNIST \
    d.)Style Transfer \
    e.)U-NET Detectron2,YOLO etc \
    
3.)**Torch Deep Dive**-This a deep dive into Neural Neworks/Image Processing with Pytorch Hooks,Interpretabillity of CNNs,LR Annealing,One cycle Scheduling etc \
\
Additionally there's a notebook by the name Torch_Experiments in which I tinker around with Apps from Pytorch Ecosystem like Ignite and Captum to name a few.\
I further plan to try-out **TorchText for NLP** with torch.\
Take a look at Pytorch Official examples [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) \
