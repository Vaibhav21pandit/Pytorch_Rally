# Pytorch_Rally
This Repository containes codes that I initially used to learn PyTorch \
\
Further it expanded to all the popular Computer Vision applications coded in PyTorch. \
\
It has 3 following Notebooks- \
1.) **Torch Basics**- \
&nbsp; &nbsp;     a.)Tensor Operations with Pytorch \
&nbsp; &nbsp;      b.)Exploring basic functions provided by the torch API,Functions from TorchVision API \
&nbsp; &nbsp;      c.)Linear/Logistic regression with torch \
&nbsp; &nbsp;      d.)Defining a Linear Neural Net and Classifying MNIST data \
&nbsp; &nbsp;      e.)Defining a CNN and classifying CIFAR-10 Data. \
2.)**Torch Advanced**- \
&nbsp; &nbsp;    a.)AutoEncoders on MNIST \
&nbsp; &nbsp;    b.)Variational AutoEncoders on MNIST \
&nbsp; &nbsp;    c.)basic GAN on MNIST \
&nbsp; &nbsp;    d.)Style Transfer \
&nbsp; &nbsp;    e.)U-NET Detectron2,YOLO etc 
    
3.)**Torch Deep Dive**- \
&nbsp; &nbsp; This a deep dive into Neural Neworks/Image Processing with Pytorch Hooks,Interpretabillity of CNNs,LR Annealing,One cycle Scheduling etc 

Additionally there's a notebook by the name Torch_Experiments in which I tinker around with Apps from Pytorch Ecosystem like Ignite and Captum to name a few.\
I further plan to try-out **TorchText for NLP** with torch.\
Take a look at Pytorch Official examples [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) \
