# Pytorch_Rally
This Repository containes codes that I initially used to learn PyTorch \
\
Further it expanded to all the popular Computer Vision applications coded in PyTorch. \
\
It has 3 following Notebooks- \
1.) **Torch Basics**-Exploring basic functions provided by the torch API,Functions from TorchVision API,Linear/Logistic regression with torch, \
Defining a Linear Neural Net and Classifying MNIST data,Defining a CNN and classifying CIFAR-10 Data. \
2.)**Torch Advanced**-AutoEncoders on MNIST,Variational AutoEncoders on MNIST,basic GAN on MNIST, Style Transfer on MNIST & a Painting,U-NET Detectron2,YOLO etc \
3.)**Torch Deep Dive**-This a deep dive into Neural Neworks/Image Processing with Pytorch Hooks,Interpretabillity of CNNs,LR Annealing etc \
\
Additionally there's a notebook by the name Torch_Experiments in which I tinker around with Apps from Pytorch Ecosystem like Ignite and Captum to name a few.\
I further plan to try-out **PyText for NLP** with torch.\
Take a look at Pytorch Official examples [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) \
