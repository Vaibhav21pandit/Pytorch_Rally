# Pytorch_Rally
This Repository containes codes that I initially used to learn PyTorch \
Further it expanded to all the popular Computer Vision applications coded in PyTorch. \
It has 3 following Notebooks- \
1.) Torch Basics-Exploring basic functions provided by the torch API,Functions from TorchVision API,Linear/Logistic regression with torch, \
Defining a Linear Neural Net and Classifying MNIST data,Defining a CNN and classifying CIFAR-10 Data.
2.)Torch Advanced-AutoEncoders on MNIST,Variational AutoEncoders on MNIST,basic GAN on MNIST, Style Transfer on MNIST & a Painting,U-NET etc \
3.)Torch Deep Dive-This a deep dive into Neural Neworks/Image Processing with Pytorch Hooks,Interpretabillity of CNNs,LR Annealing etc \
